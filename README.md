# FireForest

7gate Academy offered a 4 months bootcamp about deep learning, where several methods of machine learning and neural networks were explained.
We chose a final project about fire forest and we received (with a fellow student) a database of images from video surveillance. Each images was associated with a mask, identifying were was the fire. We decided to try two neural networks: mask RCNN and UNET-RESNET, I worked on the last one which is presented in this folder.
